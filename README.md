### RSpec have all my respects
==

RSpec needs to be our friend, so I have decided to test it. 

====

How it works? You need to download the file (albert_spec.rb) inside the challenge folder and place it in any directory where RSpec is installed. 

When you run RSpec on this file you will see that is plenty of errors, your task is to fix all of them.

The file test_spec.rb contains the right answers. 

You think it's too easy? I challenge you to make a new file with your errors and send a pull request.
