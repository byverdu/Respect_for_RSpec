### RSpec have all my respects

RSpec needs to be our friend, so I have decided to test it. 

This repo contains some examples with more meaninful of different matchers used in [RSpec](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-expectations/RSpec/Matchers).

Inside the spec folder is the orignal file, in the challenge folder you can find the error_spec.rb file which is plenty of errors that need to be fixed. I have used to try to understand how RSpec works.

### How to run the tests

1. `clone https://github.com/byverdu/Respect_for_RSpec.git`
2. `cd Respect_for_RSpec`
3. `rspec -fd`


### How to run the challenge

1. In Respect_for_RSpec folder.
2. `cd challenge`
3. `rspec -fd`
4. Fix the errors till all the tests come green.
